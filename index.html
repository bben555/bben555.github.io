            <h2>Policy Statement</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Holistic Learning Policy for the Average Indigenous and Non-Indigenous mixed Classroom</h3>
                <p>This policy statement is designed for a mixed classroom environment with both Indigenous and non-Indigenous children, creating a space where diverse cultural perspectives are honored, with particular emphasis on Indigenous worldviews and ways of knowing.</p>
                
                <h4>Our Foundational Principles:</h4>
                <p>We believe that meaningful reconciliation should begin in early childhood that lead to a lifetime commitment. Our learning environment embraces the wisdom of Indigenous perspectives while creating space for all children to develop understanding, respect, and appreciation for Indigenous histories, cultures, and ways of knowing. We commit to:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Land Acknowledgement whenever appropriate; Hence honoring the land on which our learning takes place through regular acknowledgment and teachings about the traditional territories</li>
                    <li>Integrating Indigenous languages, stories, and cultural practices throughout our curriculum, not as isolated activities but as foundational elements of our daily learning.</li>
                    <li>Provide funding and training to teachers and staff to learn about indigenous knowledge and teaching methods so they can bring it to the classroom.</li>
                    <li>Adopting a complete educational approach mirroring that of indigenous curriculum that nurture the intellectual, physical, and emotional aspects of development.</li>
                    <li>Creating continuous opportunities for families to participate in and contribute to our learning community.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h4>Alignment with TRC Calls to Action:</h4>
                <p>This policy directly addresses several TRC Calls to Action related to education, including:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Call #64:</strong> Calling upon all levels of government that provide
public funds to denominational schools to require
such schools to provide an education on comparative
religious studies, which must include a segment on
8 | Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada
Aboriginal spiritual beliefs and practic</li>
                    <li><strong>Call #62.3:</strong> Provide the necessary funding to Aboriginal schools
to utilize Indigenous knowledge and teaching
methods in classrooms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Call #62.2:</strong> Provide the necessary funding to post-secondary
institutions to educate teachers on how to integrate
Indigenous knowledge and teaching methods into
classrooms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Call #62.1:</strong> Making age-appropriate curriculum on residential schools, Treaties, and Aboriginal peoples’ historical and contemporary contributions to Canada amandatory education requirement for Kindergarten to Grade Twelve students</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Our approach recognizes that decolonization in early childhood education requires more than adding Indigenous content—it necessitates a fundamental shift in how we conceptualize teaching and learning, moving from Eurocentric frameworks toward more holistic, land-based, and relationship-centered approaches.</p>

                <h3>Physical Environment</h3>
                <p>Assuming we can design any classroom from scratch, my ideal classroom would look a lot different from the average classrooms in place currently every school in Canada.
                    The most striking difference would be the inclusion of outdoor space in every classroom through the form of a porch/greenhouse/balcony. By having indoor and outdoor spaces, it will be easier to incorporate 
                    demonstrations of indigenous knowledge such as singing, dancing, crafting, familization with elements of nature etc. </p>

                    <li>Flexible, movable furniture allowing for gathering in circles</li>
                    <li>Low shelving with natural materials and loose parts for exploration</li>
